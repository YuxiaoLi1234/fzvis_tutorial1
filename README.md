## Input Data Vis:
- After running the compressors, you can visualize the slice of your input data in module C.
- Make sure that you input your slice_id, format of your inputdata.
- Click on the DataVis button to visualize your data.
- There is a defaultcolormap selector on the top left. You can also add control points by clicking on the colormap for the colormap (under the mode of "add_points")/ drag the existing control points (under the mode of "use current control points").
